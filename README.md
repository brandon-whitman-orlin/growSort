# growSort
A sorting algorithm akin to Bogo sort.

growSort works quite similarly to Bogo sort. It takes a list and checks if it is sorted.

If the list IS sorted:
- Return the list.

If the list IS NOT sorted: add a new element to the list:
- Add a new element to the list.
- Shuffle the list.
- Check the list again.
